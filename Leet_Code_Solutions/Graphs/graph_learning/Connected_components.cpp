// Connected Component of an undirected graph is a  connected subgraph which is not part of any larger subgraph.
// and every node is connected directly or indirectly to every other node of that component.

// The components of any graph partition it's vertices into disjoint sets,
//  and are induced subgraphs of those sets.
